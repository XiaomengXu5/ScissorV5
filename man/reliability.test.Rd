\description{
Performs the reliability significance test to determine whether the inferred phenotype-to-cell
associations are reliable (statistical p-value less than 0.05) or are false positives.
}
\details{
This statistical test can determine whether the inferred phenotype-to-cell associations are
reliable (statistical p-value less than 0.05) or are false positives.

The motivation for the reliability significance test is: if the chosen single-cell and bulk data are not suitable for
the phenotype-to-cell associations, the correlations would be less informative and not well associated with the phenotype
labels. Thus, the corresponding prediction performance would be poor and not be significantly distinguishable from the
randomly permutated labels.

The evaluation measurements used in the reliability significance test are the mean squared error (MSE) for linear regression,
the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for classification, and the concordance index (c-index) for Cox regression.

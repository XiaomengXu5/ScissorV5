\title{Cell level evaluations on the Scissor selected cells}
\usage{
evaluate.cell(Load_file, Scissor_result, FDR_cutoff = 0.05, bootstrap_n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{Load_file}{File name for loading the preprocessed regression inputs.}

\item{Scissor_result}{Output variable from Scissor.}

\item{FDR_cutoff}{FDR cutoff in the correlation test for each pair of bulk sample and single-cell. The default value is 0.05.}

\item{bootstrap_n}{Bootstrap resampling times.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} with rows are the Scissor selected cells. The columns contain the following attributes:
  \item{Mean correlation}{The mean correlation of a cell with all bulk samples.}
  \item{Correlation > 0}{The percentage of positive correlations of a cell with all bulk samples.}
  \item{Correlation < 0}{The percentage of negative correlations of a cell with all bulk samples.}
  \item{Significant Correlation}{The percentage of significant correlations (FDR < \code{FDR_cutoff}) of a cell with all bulk samples.}
  \item{Coefficient}{The regression coefficient beta calculated in Scissor.}
  \item{Beta 0\%}{The minimum value of bootstrap coefficient.}
  \item{Beta 25\%}{The lower quartile of bootstrap coefficient.}
  \item{Beta 50\%}{The median value of bootstrap coefficient.}
  \item{Beta 75\%}{TThe upper quartile of bootstrap coefficient.}
  \item{Beta 100\%}{The maximum value of bootstrap coefficient.}
  \item{Probability of zero}{The probability of a cell is not selected in bootstrap resamplings.}
}
\description{
This function perfroms evaluations for each Scissor selected cell.
}
\details{
This function uses two main strategies to evaluate each Scissor selected cell. The first strategy focuses on the correlation values
and their corresponding p-values for each selected cell with all bulk samples, which includes the first four columns in the output variable.
The second strategy uses the nonparametric bootstrap to assess the coefficient distribution for each Scissor selected cell.
